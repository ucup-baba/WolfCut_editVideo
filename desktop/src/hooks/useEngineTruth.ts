/**
 * The engine's true frames for the monitor: the paused dwell and the
 * playback stream, one owner.
 *
 * Paused: when the playhead settles, fetch the exporter's own composite and
 * hold it over the approximation until the playhead moves. Playing: while
 * two or more visual layers sit under the playhead, stream frames against
 * the transport clock - requests are
 * quantised to the project's frame grid and issued one measured round-trip
 * ahead of the interpolated playhead, so a frame lands about when it is
 * due; each presented frame also warms the engine's cache for the instants
 * after it (desktop decision 0009). Single layers keep the smooth element
 * preview. Both paths fetch at the user's preview quality - a fraction of
 * the output frame, chosen in the monitor's footer.
 *
 * The request carries an instant and a resolution, nothing else: the engine
 * flattens its own session (engine decision 0009). The UI used to serialise
 * its whole flattened clip list into every one of these requests - per
 * scrub, per streamed frame.
