//! Turning a timeline plus a timestamp into one finished frame.
//!
//! Rendering splits in two, and the split is the important part of this crate:
//!
//! 1. [`plan`] answers "what is on screen at this instant, from where, and how
//!    strongly". It touches no pixels and does no IO, so it is fast, exactly
//!    testable, and identical for the CPU and GPU backends.
//! 2. [`compositor`] takes that plan plus the decoded pixels and blends them.
//!
//! Only step 2 is backend-specific. See
//! `docs/decisions/0004-cpu-compositor-first.md`.
//!
//! [`blend`] sits underneath step 2: the colour arithmetic each backend has to
//! agree on, kept away from the pixel plumbing so it can be tested on numbers.
