//! Rendering a timeline to a file.
//!
//! This is the seam where a flattened clip list becomes the engine's
//! `wolfcut_core::Timeline`, and from there the engine decides everything -
//! what is on screen (`wolfcut-render`), what the sound means
//! (`wolfcut_media::audio`), and how bytes move (`wolfcut-media`). Transition
//! semantics resolve here too: by the time the picture and sound paths read
//! the clip list, transitions have already become overlaps, opacity ramps and
//! fade filters.
//!
//! This crate used to live inside the desktop host, which put editing
//! semantics (`resolve_transitions`) on the wrong side of the bridge. It
//! lives in the engine now so the CLI, the host and any future frontend
//! render one way, and so the doctrine holds: the host converts wire formats
//! and reports progress, nothing more.
//!
//! Picture is composited frame by frame - on the GPU when the `gpu` feature
//! is on and the machine has one, with the CPU compositor as the
//! always-correct fallback. Sound is planned by the engine as one FFmpeg
//! filtergraph and mixed in a single pass.
