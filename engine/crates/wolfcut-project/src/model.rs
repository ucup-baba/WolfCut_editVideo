//! The document model: what a WolfCut project *is*.
//!
//! Times are `f64` seconds here because that is what the on-disk format
//! stores, and the documents that exist freeze the format (the provisional
//! TS twin this shape once mirrored is deleted; decision 0007). The
//! conversion to exact rationals stays at the render boundary -
//! `wolfcut-export`'s timeline builder. Moving the *document* to rational
//! time is a format decision for a deliberate version 2, made once, here.
//!
//! Serde names are camelCase so a document written by this crate is byte-level
//! compatible with one written by the TypeScript side.
